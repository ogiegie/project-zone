        I was meant to go to the gym today…. but decided against it. I had an epiphany, it’s as they said “a flood gate
        has been opened” rush of emotions, reasons ideology philosophy all sending signals simultaneous to my central,
        my brain creating a cocktail of chaos I must say, but in all I must find a center a place of tranquility, solace
        to process all this and above all make sense of it. Mankind was built special because we are meant to process
        our thoughts before we perform it as an action aka turning our inner noun into a verb, and that’s the problem
        with humanity they say, when we process things we lose its original meaning we skew its purpose we modify it.

        <b>I am African</b><br> but I struggle with its cultural belief and practices which has extended to our
        education religious and professional conduct, it’s hard to miss it, am a Nigeria from the southern part of
        Nigeria and there’s always these culture shock when you move, say to the East West or Northern part of Nigeria
        and am talking at the urban level,

        How does it correlate to what I am saying selling hope its good business, what is hope?, <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/" target="blank">Webster dictionary</a> define hope as; a feeling of expectation and
        desire for a particular thing to happen, interestingly the bible or should I said Christians defines hope as the
        confident expectation of what God has promised and its strength is in his faithfulness, well Mr. Webster say
        hope is an expectation and desire (simili for desire; wish want fancy) for a particular thing to happen now the
        bible contradicts that, replaced particular thing with God’s promise, went further to say, the likelihood of
        that promise materializing depends on your faithfulness (AKA faith). What is faith? the bible in Hebrew 11:1
        said faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen (I know...the last part kinda
        ambiguous the bible is like that one statement a hundred interpretation) well this one interpretation I know in
        my journey through Christianity as most of us most undertake in the southern part of Nigeria (in fact it was of
        recent they started adding other religions in our forms is was strictly Muslim or Christian), because it was
        said repeated from different pastors with different doctrines but they all agreed that faith is believing in
        things not seen kind of what webster was saying with hope, but now it gets interesting, they said, that
        particular thing you so fancy wish want and desire is Gods promise, at this point I deserve a ride on pastor
        (Ride on pastor!), thank you. I know what you thinking what is God’s promise (way ahead of you pal)
        Christianity; they (Christians) said it’s a personal race (subjective) but <b>God’s</b> promise the very center of it
        all should be objective well I decide to pose this question to 3 different characters with a common trait (pure
        love and respect for God, was also tempted to ask a friend named Christian same question…hahaha ope u got the
        joke) I also asked them for scriptural backing to keep them in track. Wanted to tell you the things I did
        in-between while waiting for their answers, well…let just says my life is very eventful (speaking as a faithful
        Christian…you gerrit, if you don’t gerrit, forget about it). Ok I said earlier three characters, three for a
        reason, the first is a fired up young pastors with scripture in his vein already made the LORDs work his
        inheritance, the other a church going brother with sound biblical foundation and knowledge, only pledge
        allegiance to the
